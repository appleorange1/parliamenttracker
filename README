*Requirements*

This software was built and tested on Arch Linux ARM, but other
Linux distributions should be fine.

You will need the following dependencies to build the software:
Needed for both Victoria and Queensland
-wget

-make

-tar

Only needed for Victoria:
-The docx2txt.pl script, written by Sandeep Kumar, stored as
 /usr/bin/docx2txt.pl (or otherwise in your PATH). I'm using
 version 1.4.

-zlib (including the -dev packages on Debian/Ubuntu). I'm using
 version 1.2.8.

-GCC. I'm using version 6.2.1 20160830.

Only needed for Queensland:

-Python 3

-The Python 3 version of pdfminer, which you can install using pip:
 $ pip install pdfminer.six
 I'm using version 20160614.

On Arch, you can install these packages with the command:
# pacman -S docx2txt zlib gcc wget make tar python pip
# pip install pdfminer.six

*Build*
To build the website, you will need some data from the Parliament websites.
While the Queensland Parliament documentation can be downloaded automatically,
the Victorian Parliament documentation is moved quite frequently on the server,
and I have not yet found a way to download it automatically.

To get the Queensland documentation, run the command:
$ make qlddocs

To get the Victorian documentation, download all of the docx files from:
http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/votes-aamp-proceeding-minutes
http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/council/minutes-of-proceedings
Please keep the original filenames (but remove anything after the "docx").

To build the website, run the commands:
$ make release

If you just want to make the Victorian or Queensland websites, you
can use "make vicrelease", and "make qldrelease".

*Installing*
If you just want to keep the website for personal viewing, just open
index.html in a webbrowser. The website will work just as if you were
accessing it online.

If you want the website to be accessible on the internet, you'll need
a webserver, such as Apache.
To install, uncompress parliamenttracker_website_current.tar.xz in the
root directory of your webserver.
