*Requirements*

This software was built and tested on Arch Linux ARM, but other
Linux distributions should be fine.

You will need the following dependencies to build the software:
-The docx2txt.pl script, written by Sandeep Kumar, stored as
 /usr/bin/docx2txt.pl (or otherwise in your PATH). I'm using
 version 1.4.

-zlib (including the -dev packages on Debian/Ubuntu). I'm using
 version 1.2.8.

-GCC. I'm using version 6.2.1 20160830.

-wget

-make

-tar

On Arch, you can install these packages with the command:
# pacman -S docx2txt zlib gcc wget make tar

*Build*
To build the website, run the commands:
$ make docs
$ make release

The "make docs" command downloads about 8MB of data from the 
Victorian Parliament's website. Once you've run it once, you don't
need to run it again for future builds. Just running "make release" 
is enough.

*Installing*
If you just want to keep the website for personal viewing, just open
index.html in a webbrowser. The website will work just as if you were
accessing it online.

If you want the website to be accessible on the internet, you'll need
a webserver, such as Apache.
To install, uncompress parliamenttracker_website_current.tar.xz in the
root directory of your webserver.
