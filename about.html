</center>
<p>
	The Victorian Parliament Tracker and the Queensland Parliament Tracker generate reports for divisions that happen in Parliament. This page attempts to explain in further detail how they work, what they can and can't do and how you can help.
</p>
<b style="color: darkcyan;">How can I contact you?</b>
<p>
	You can email us at <a href="mailto:riley@openmailbox.org">riley@openmailbox.org</a>.
</p>
<b style="color: orangered;">How is the data on this website generated?</b>
<p>
	We use an open-source program to extract data from publicly available information on Parliament websites. <a href="https://github.com/appleorange1/parliamenttracker">Check it out on Github</a>!
</p>
<b style="color: darkcyan;">How can I help?</b>
<p>
	The computer program can't write summaries; humans have to do that. Take a look through the list of <a href="index/assembly.html">Victorian Assembly divisions</a>, the list of <a href="index/council.html">Victorian Council divisions</a> and the list of <a href="qld/index/assembly.html">Queensland Assembly divisions</a>, email us summaries and we'll put them on the website.
</p>
<p>
	If you can code, we'd love to make the website work better. <a href="https://github.com/appleorange1/parliamenttracker">Send us a pull request on Github</a>.
</p>
<b style="color: orangered;">Are there any other websites like this?</b>
<p>
	The <a href="http://openaustralia.org.au/">OpenAustralia Foundataion</a> runs a website called <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/">They Vote For You</a>, which tracks members of the Federal Parliament.
</p>
<b style="color: darkcyan">I can't find a certain issue on here!</b>
<p>
Try looking through the full list of divisions for the <a href="index/assembly.html">Victorian Assembly</a>, the <a href="index/council.html">Victorian Council</a> and the <a href="qld/index/assembly.html">Queensland Assembly</a>. They go back to 3 September 2015, 10 February 2015 and 25 March 2015 respectively.
</p>
<p>
	This website only records <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_assembly">divisions</a>. If there was just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_vote">voice vote</a>, then we can't know how individual MPs voted.
</p>
<p>
	If you're sure that a division isn't being picked up, it's probably a bug. Send us an email.
</p>
<p>
<b style="color: orangered;">Mistakes and errors</b>
<p>
The pages on this website were generated automatically by a computer program. We try to make sure it works properly, but sometimes a mistake might get through. 
</p>
<p>
If you find a mistake, please email us and we'll try to get it fixed.
</p>
<b style="color: darkcyan;">Interpreting the data</b>
<p>
You shouldn't rely on this data being error-free, and we will not take any responsibility for anything which happens if you do.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the risk that the computer program might make a mistake, you need to know how to interpret the data.
</p>
<p>
The official titles of divisions do not always reflect what is actually being voted on. For example, this could be because the house is actually voting on an amendment to the bill or because they are voting on whether to stop debating now and come back to it later. 
</p>
<p>
To find out what a vote is actually about, you should check  <a href="http://hansard.parliament.vic.gov.au">Hansard</a>, the <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/council/minutes-of-proceedings">Minutes of Proceedings</a> (Council) or the <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/votes-aamp-proceeding-minutes">Votes and Proceedings</a> (Assembly).
</p>
<p>
This website also only explains how a politician voted when the division happened. They could have changed their position on an issue after the vote took place.
