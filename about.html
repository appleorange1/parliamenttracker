<p>
	The Victorian Parliament Tracker generates reports for divisions that happen in Parliament. This page attempts to explain in further detail how it works, what it can and can't do and how you can help.
</p>
<b>How is the data on this website generated?</b>
<p>
	Most of the pages on this website are made with the help of an open-source program which extracts data from the
	<a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/votes-aamp-proceeding-minutes">Votes and Proceedings</a> files (for the Legislative Assembly) and the <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/council/minutes-of-proceedings">Minutes of Proceedings</a> files (for the Legislative Council).
</p>
<p>
	The human-readable summaries are written by humans.
</p>
<b>How can I help?</b>
<ul>
	<li>Write more human-readable summaries of divisions and send them to me</li>
	<li>Make improvements, extensions or fixes to the program or website</li>
	<li>Spread the word!</li>
</ul>
<b>I can't find a certain issue on here!</b>
<p>
	There are several possible reasons for this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	This website can only provide voting results on issues where a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_assembly">division</a> was held. In many cases, only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_vote">voice vote</a> is held, which means that the votes of individual MPs aren't recorded.
</li>
<li>
<p>
The Legislative Council data goes back to 3 September 2015 and the Legislative Assembly data goes back to 10 February 2015.
</p>
<p>
We have no objection to including older data; it just isn't a priority for us at the moment. If you can get the program working with older data, let us know and we'll include it. If you need help understanding where to start, just ask and we'll try to be of assistance.
</p>
</li>
<li>
	There may be a bug in the program which skips over your division. If this is the case, send us a link to the Votes and Proceedings/Minutes of Proceedings file with the division in it.
</li>
</ul>
<b>Are there any other websites like this?</b>
<p>
	The <a href="http://openaustralia.org.au/">OpenAustralia Foundataion</a> runs a website called <a href="https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/">They Vote For You</a>, which tracks members of the Federal Parliament.
</p>
<p>
	The computer program which generates these pages takes the title of each section and produces a summary of how members voted in that division.
</p>
<p>
	In many cases, the section titles are misleading. This is because the actual question on which the house divides is not picked up by the computer program.
</p>
<p>
For example, instead of actually voting on the bill, the house may actually be voting on whether an amendment to the bill should be accepted or whether the debate should be adjourned to a later time.
